        <h2>Plot</h2>
        <p>After the events of <em>"The HIT"</em> everything started changing. Literally changing. People were made to
            follow government directives that were enforced to stay safe. But it seemed like the government was taking
            advantage of the situation. Revolution Brewed, and nobody knew what was coming.</p>
        <p>You play as <strong>Evon Scratch</strong> newly appointed Graphics lead in the Government HQ. Your job is to
            make and remake all the <em>flags</em> as per the Directives. Maintain the job to sustain this economic
            downfall with your family. Failing in the job will cost you heavy penalities. <em> Although Sustenance is
                luxury, Survival is necessary</em></p>

                Any
                changes you make will come with <strong><em> heavy penalty.</em></strong></p>

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>The core loop is to make flags and earn money to sustain the family. The initial format of the flag will
                be given and at the beginning (tutorial) the player just repeats the same pattern. And as the in-game
                days progress <strong>New Directives</strong> starts coming. These can be anything from change one color
                to another, patterns that hatch left to hatch right, a star symbol to a banana symbol and so on.</p>

            <p>These <em><strong>Directives</strong></em> are stackable. Which makes it frustrating when you lose track
                of the changes. Which will force the player to keep the project on hold and lose the income, rather than
                letting it be wrong and face the penalty?</p>
            <p>At the end of each workday there is a place where the player spends the money. According to the events
                that happened that particular day requests, bills will populate the end day screen and the player makes
                decisions on how they want to spend that money. <em>These decitions</em> will affect the storyline and
                branch to multiple endings.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-center">DAY 1</h4>
                    <p class="a">The walk to work is not so bad. Except for the huge line in front of the detention
                        center, the
                        protestors in the opposites with their signs. Calling out the government policies, some banners
                        even had
                        heart signs on them. People fighting for peace. Liberals, I don't know where they get money for
                        their
                        food. It was not easy to get this job with my reputation in street painting. Just needed a
                        facelift,
                        some
                        polish, some make-up, and viola - <em> "Graphics designer for the federal government".</em> But
                        I can't
                        go protesting now, those were the days...</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong><em>BANG!!!</em></strong></p>
                    <p>"<em>Stop daydreaming Mr.Scratch.</em> You've got work to do.", A well-dressed man with a
                        noticeably long
                        face says as he slams a hefty pile of paperwork.</p>

                    <p>"Exact copies like noted in the job sheets, no changes... You know what happens if you change
                        <i>anything</i> right?"</p>
                    <p>"Sir! Yes! Sir!"</p>
                    <p class="a">It's only been a few days and the directives have been pouring out. Change this, change
                        that,
                        ever since the meteor fell it's been so weird. We have to change everything. Even the one's that
                        we
                        already changed. Sounds complicated right? that's exactly how it is. You have to do it to feel
                        it. But
                        they pay well.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><i><small> (Phone rings)</small></i></p>
                    <p>"Evon... listen? I just got a call from Carol's school. She is not feeling so well. I'll take her
                        to the
                        hospital so... there is credit in the card right? I don't have anything else with credit..."</p>
                    <p>"Marilin what..?? When did you get the call? what did they say?"</p>
                    <p>"She's just fainted... it seems, I've already called a cab. Just tell the card has credits."</p>
                    <p>"Yea yea... I think it does. Anyways they only take the payment at the end of the day. I'll make
                        some
                        extra flags or something... call me when you get to the hospital."</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><i><small>(line disconnects)</i></small></p>
                    <p>Evon got to work. For every flag, he made and maintained with the current directives he got extra
                        credit.
                        But it is risky. The more flag he made the more he had to maintain. And change when a new
                        directive
                        comes into action. Which means he will lose a lot more credits if he can't keep up. Evon knows
                        that but
                        he has no choice in this current economic crisis.</p>
                    <p class="a">Everyone takes risks. And I can manage a couple more flags. I have to be careful not to
                        overwhelm the work load. Let's just focus on work an wait for Marilin to call back.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><i><small>(Not long after phone rings)</small></i></p>
                    <p>"Hey.. What did they say? Is Carol alright?"</p>
                    <p>"Hello Sir! Am I talking to Mr. Evon Scratch?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes that's me."</p>
                    <p>"I'm sorry. I don't who Carol is. My name is Ron. I'm calling for the 'Voice of the people'
                        movement. We
                        got your contact from our members list. Would you like to donate to our cause.", a calm voice
                        from the
                        other side of the the phone.</p>
                    <p>"What? Dude listen I don't have time for this. I'm waiting for another call okay?"</p>
                    <p>"I'm sorry to disturb you sir. But if you don't mind is it anything to do with the person named
                        Carol you
                        mentioned before." there was no hurry in that voice.</p>
                    <p>"Look thats none of your business, if you don't mind I am going to disconnect this call. Do not
                        call this
                        number again."</p>
                    <p>"But Sir was Carol in any of the schools in the neighbourhood?", she asks</p>
                    <p>"Yes. HOW DO YOU KNOW?"</p>
                    <p>"There are several reports on Children fainting in schools today, they are going to be taken to
                        the
                        detention centers. I would suggest you act quickly. And also please consider donating to the
