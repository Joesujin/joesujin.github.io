  <!--Setup-->

      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <p>All players receive a Head Card and 10 life tokens. A pile of kas and life tokens, Events and items card sets,
        and
        the Auctioneers token are given to the first Auctioneer. The Auctioneer is the guardian of all common items.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!--Gameplay-->
  <div class="row mt-3" id="syh-gameplay">
    <div class="col-12">
      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
      <p>To provide a dynamic flow to every playthrough there are no set rules but only a <strong>structure</strong> to
        play the game.
        One
        of
        the 3 player assume the role of an auctioneer. The role of the auctioneer cycles through the players for each
        round.
        The auctioneer sets the rules of the game for that round. The next player can follow the same rules or make up
        their
        own.</p>
      <p class="font-weight-light font-italic">Every round is like a day and consists of three sections.</p>
      <p><b>Registration</b> starts as the Auctioneer deals <em>3 Event cards</em> to the each of the two players. We
        can
        call them bidders. Followed by the Event cards the bidders also get their income of <em>9 Kas.</em> Event card
        gives
        a brief of an event and its penalties. An event can be anything and all events have an item associated with
        them.
        The items can be purchased during the Auction.</p>
      <p><b>Rumble</b> starts when the auctioneer puts out 3 item cards for sale. The rules of the auction is all set by
        the
        current auctioneer. But there can only be 3 items for sale in one auction.</p>
      <p><b>Reveal</b> starts once the auction is completed. The two bidders show off their events and if any items
        bought
        during the auction to rectify any event. All losses are calculated and returned to the common pile of kas and
        life.
        And the next player assumes the role of the auctioneer.</p>
      <p>The game ends with the last man standing.</p>

      <h2>Development</h2>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!--Events-->
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-12">
      <h4>Events</h4>
      <p>
        <p>An event card consists of an event title, descriptions, penalties for that event, type of event, and a
          remedy.
          The event had their own types and highly contextual for that event. This type of format needed to be followed
          through out. It is necessary for the events to have their own unique format to give the auctioneer opportunity
          to
          improvise and modify their rule. It also promotes conflict between players giving them the opportunity to
          discover
          the other player's intents.</p>
        <p>After testing with the inital prototype, I made a new set of cards that are closer to any normal card game.
          To provide a clear difference between the event and the item cards the orientation of the event card changed
          to horizontal with a corner cut. Event types are now color coded. </p>

  </div>



  <!--Items-->
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-12">
      <h5>Items</h5>
      <p>Items cards are the remedies for the events. They are put up for sale by the auctioneer. It has the items
        name,
        item descriptions and its initial cost. Each item needs to match their event. The initial cost is only the
        starting price for the aution and the auctioneer can modify it according to their wish. Item are also
        contextual
        to
        their respective events.</p>
      <p>The items are also color coded. Adding to that is another icon to convey the behavior of that particular
        item. Rectify, Retaliate are the initial item types. The rectify card is used to counter a particular event.
        There can be multiple events that might need the same Item card. But an item card can only used for one event.
        If there are two events that need the same items, the player must have two of the same item cards to counter
        them.</p>

  <!--HeadCards-->

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-12">
      <h5>Head cards</h5>
      <p>There are the player token with a special purpose. In the time of need the player can sell their head card to
        get
        a
        decent amount of kas. This is like a one up for all the player. For a party of 3 player there are 4 headcards
        so
        the extra head card will be put in the events deck. if a player without a head card gets one from in a deal
        the
        player gets a one up. If a player with a head card gets dealt a head card again, s/he can swap the card but
        has to
        give it back during the reveal.</p>

  <!--kas and life-->
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
      <h5>Kas and Life</h5>
      <p>These are the two types of currencies in the game. Kas is the money derived from the <strong>Tamil</strong>
        word for money <em><strong>"kasu"</strong>.</em> This currency is used to buy and sell Items. Life is health
        and these life tokens are distributed in the beginning of the game to all the players. The penalties are taken
        off of the player after each round</p>

  <!--Target Audience-->
  <div class="row mt-3" id="syh-targetaudience">
    <div class="col-12">
      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>The cards are designed with events that can be relatable and funny for the general audience. Keeping in mind
        that there would be tensed situations in-game and to insert stress busters, the cards waive a funny narrative
        with each other. Players had moments where they could make fun of each other on the events they got. The content
        of the cards can be altered to cater to any age group. The current prototype is designed for the 16+ age group.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!--Design Insights-->
  <div class="row mt-3" id="syh-dinsights">
    <div class="col-12">
      <h2>Design Insights</h2>
      <p>The game has an ulterior motive. By establishing one of the three players will be the winner puts everyone up
        against each other. And by letting players to freely manipulate the rules makes it more personal and
        empowering.
        These two subtle hints pushes players into a pursuing their personal goals to achieve the win condition. </p>
      <p>Initially there might be radical rules imposed by the active Auctioneer, which in turn decides the flow of
        the
        game. But since the power shifts from player to player the initial rules can change or like most cases during
        my
        playtests initial rules set by the first auctioneer will dictate how the game is going to play out. The card
        descriptions are designed to focus on making the event feel relatable and personal to increase immersion in
        the
        game. And ownership of items also brings out Endowment effect in people. The game ties to create a safe
        environment to bring out major concepts in behavioural economics.</p>
      <p>As for the ulterior motive of the game, <em>the <strong>player</strong> succeeds</em> if s/he is the sole
        survivor and the others have lost their lives. But <em>the <strong>game </strong>succeeds </em>if there is a
        stalemate and no one can see an end to the game. It means the 3 players have understood the importance of
        communication and well-informed rational decisions. Ultimately it leads to a non-zero sum game at every round.
