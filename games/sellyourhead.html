  <h1>Sell Your head</h1>
  <h2>A game on Game Theory</h2>
</header>
<div>
  <h3>Project Brief</h3>
  <p>Applying Game Theory principles into the design process, focusing on a learning experience through play. A game
    that
    can steer player's thinking towards making well-informed rational decisions.</p>
  <h3>Game Description</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>3 players</li>
    <li>45 min playtime</li>
    <li>Card Game(tabeltop)<ul>
        <li>Card sets - Events, Items, Head cards</li>
        <li>Kas(currency) and life(health) tokens</li>
        <li>Auctioneers token.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Setup</h3>
  <p>All players receive a Head Card and 10 life tokens. A pile of kas and life tokens, Events and items card sets,
    and
    the Auctioneers token are given to the first Auctioneer. The Auctioneer is the guardian of all common items.</p>
  <h3>Gameplay</h3>
  <p>To provide a dynamic flow to every playthrough there are no set rules but only a structure to play the game.
    One
    of
    the 3 player assume the role of an auctioneer. The role of the auctioneer cycles through the players for each
    round.
    The auctioneer sets the rules of the game for that round. The next player can follow the same rules or make up
    their
    own.</p>
  <p>Every round is like a day and consists of three sections.</p>
  <p><b>Registration</b> starts as the Auctioneer deals <em>3 Event cards</em> to the each of the two players. We
    can
    call them bidders. Followed by the Event cards the bidders also get their income of <em>9 Kas.</em> Event card
    gives
    a brief of an event and its penalties. An event can be anything and all events have an item associated with
    them.
    The items can be purchased during the Auction.</p>
  <p><b>Rumble</b> starts when the auctioneer puts out 3 item cards for sale. The rules of the auction is all set by
    the
    current auctioneer. But there can only be 3 items for sale in one auction.</p>
  <p><b>Reveal</b> starts once the auction is completed. The two bidders show off their events and if any items
    bought
    during the auction to rectify any event. All losses are calculated and returned to the common pile of kas and
    life.
    And the next player assumes the role of the auctioneer.</p>
  <p>The game ends with the last man standing.</p>
  <h3>Design Insights</h3>
  <p>The game has an ulterior motive. By establishing one of the three players will be the winner puts everyone up
    against each other. And by letting players to freely manipulate the rules makes it more personal and empowering.
    These two subtle hints pushes players into a pursuing their personal goals to achieve the win condition. </p>
  <p>Initially there might be radical rules imposed by the active Auctioneer, which in turn decides the flow of the
    game. But since the power shifts from player to player the initial rules can change or like most cases during my
    playtests initial rules set by the first auctioneer will dictate how the game is going to play out. The card
    descriptions are designed to focus on making the event feel relatable and personal to increase immersion in the
    game. And ownership of items also brings out Endowment effect in people. The game ties to create a safe
    environment to bring out major concepts in behavioural economics.</p>
  <p>As for the ulterior motive of the game, <em>the <strong>player</strong> succeeds</em> if s/he is the sole
    survivor and the others have lost their lives. But <em>the <strong>game </strong>succeeds </em>if there is a
    stalemate and no one can see an end to the game. It means the 3 players have understood the importance of
    communication and well-informed rational decisions. Ultimately it leads to a non-zero sum game at every round.
