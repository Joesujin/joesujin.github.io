      <p>You get up one day and you find a letter in your nightstand it says.</p>

          <p><i>“ Dear citizen of the free worlds</i></p>
          <p><i>As we all know we have a population crisis in our hands and we’ve been trying to get out of our Mother
              Earth
              for
              a while now. But with our newest breakthrough in Quantum Physics, we found a way to create Quantum worlds
              on
              daily
              objects( mostly spherical ones just to keep the consistency)</i></p>
          <p><i>You are one of the lucky ones to be put in one of our greatest and most sophisticated Quantum worlds
              created
              yet. And this is to inform you that there might be some unusual behaviors in your world as it is most
              likely
              to be
              entangled with one of the other worlds as an object of some sort.</i></p>
          <p><i>Hence this physical letter is superpositioned across worlds.</i></p>
          <p><i>We hope you live happily ever after.</i></p>
          <p><i>(P.s. all your friends, family and loved ones are replicated in this world and a whole lot of other
              people
              for
              you to explore)</i></p>
          <p><i>You will forget this letter in 24hrs as it will cease to exist.</i></p>
          <p><i>Thank you for your cooperation.”</i></p>

      <p>You look out of your window and you see nothing out of the usual. You decide to take a walk. It’s the same
        place
        you know. Same neighborhood, same people, same queues. Time seems to move a bit faster. There are mild jerks
        that
        you feel now and then but everything seems to be fine. You get a coffee and reach back home. It is already dusk
        but
        you read the letter again you find yourself questioning.</p>
      <p>Where am I? Is this another world that someone created? What do they mean <em>“some sort of spherical
          object”</em>
        for all you know you might be living on a kids football that is kicked around or on a wrecking ball that is
        demolishing buildings back in the real earth to make room for trees and other animals. Maybe that’s why there
        are
        these jerks now and then.</p>
      <p>Will you be willing to live in a world that breaks stuff or one that’s being kicked around? Are you willing to
        sleep on it and live in this false world? Around these fake people? You decide to jump out of the window. The
        last
        breath fills your lungs mid-air and everything goes dark.</p>
      <p>And then you wake up.</p>
