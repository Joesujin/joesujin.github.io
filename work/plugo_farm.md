### Overview
Plugo Farm is an AR-powered farm kit where kids manage their own digital farm using real physical toys. It bridges tactile play with digital feedback.

### Key Features
*   **Tactile Interaction**: Place real farm pieces (barns, tractors, animals) to build in the game.
*   **Business Logic**: Learn basics of resource management and time management.
*   **Story Missions**: Engaging narratives that require solving farm problems.

### Role & Contribution
As Senior Game Designer, I owned the mechanics-to-kit translation. I designed the interaction model where physical placement triggers digital events, ensuring the hardware (camera/mirror) limitations were masked by intuitive gameplay.
