### Overview
A multiplayer car battle-race where players must dodge obstacles, outdrive friends, and be the last car rolling. It combines racing mechanics with survival party game elements.

### Key Features
*   **Multiplayer Mayhem**: Compete against friends or matchmaking opponents.
*   **Physics-Based Chaos**: Dynamic obstacles and car physics create unpredictable fun.
*   **Survival Mode**: It’s not just about speed; it’s about surviving the track.

### Design Approach
The goal was to create "Streamable Chaos." The systems were designed to encourage funny moments and near-misses that players would want to share. Balancing the physics to be forgiving yet chaotic was key to the "stumble" feel.
