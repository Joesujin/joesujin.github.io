### Overview
Plugo Detective turns the tablet into a crime-solving gadget. Kids use a real physical sliding glass gizmo to solve puzzles on screen, engaging in logic and deduction missions.

### Key Features
*   **Physical Gizmo**: Use a slider lens to hunt for clues and decrypt codes.
*   **Logic Puzzles**: Deductive reasoning challenges disguised as spy missions.
*   **Whodunnit Mysteries**: Narrative-driven cases with multiple suspects.

### Design Focus
The core loop revolves around "Observation and Deduction." I focused on creating puzzles that required children to pay attention to details in the physical world (via the lens) to progress in the digital narrative.
