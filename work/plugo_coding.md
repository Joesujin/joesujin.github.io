### Overview
Plugo Coding teaches the fundamentals of programming—sequences, loops, and conditions—without any screens-only abstraction. Kids simply snap physical blocks to issue commands.

### Key Features
*   **Physical Coding**: Commands are physical blocks (Move, Jump, Loop).
*   **Progressive Learning**: Levels scale from basic sequencing to complex functions.
*   **Creative Problem Solving**: Open-ended challenges that allow multiple solutions.

### Design Contributions
Focused on the "Tangible Syntax" problem—how to make physical blocks represent abstract code concepts intuitively for a 5-year-old. Designed the progression curve to introduce loops and conditionals as "shortcuts" rather than complex rules.
